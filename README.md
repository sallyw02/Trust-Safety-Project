Title: Leveraging New Language Models to Combat Sextortion on Discord
Time: April 2024 - June 2024
In my "Trust and Safety" class, I learned about different types of trust and safety abuses, and how companies can design and implement technologies to target them. For the final project, my group focused on leveraging new large language models to target sextortion on Discord. We implemented manual reporting as well as automated sextortion detection and report generation. We compared the efficacy of Gemini and OpenAI models and evaluated that OpenAI produced better scores in both Recall and Precision. We presented our results to several dozen guest judges from industry T&S teams, answering any questions they had and discussing possible improvements we could incorporate. Our feedback was overwhelmingly positive and I achieved a final grade of 97% (A) in this class.
